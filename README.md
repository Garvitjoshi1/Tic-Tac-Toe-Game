Here are the general steps you could follow to create a Tic Tac Toe game with a GUI using Python and the Pygame library:
1. Install Pygame: First, make sure Pygame is installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip command: pip install pygame.
2. Import the necessary libraries: Start by importing the Pygame and Sys libraries.
3. Initialize Pygame: Initialize Pygame by calling pygame.init().
4. Set the screen dimensions: Set the dimensions of the game window using pygame.display.set_mode().
5. Create the game board: Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board using Pygame's built-in drawing functions.
6. Create the game logic: Write the code to handle user input and update the game state accordingly.
7. Display the game state: Use Pygame to display the game board and update it as the game progresses.
8. Add game over logic: Determine when the game is over and display the winner or a tie message.
9. Add restart functionality: Allow the user to restart the game after it has ended.
10. Run the game: Start the game loop using pygame.event.get() and pygame.display.update().
These are just general steps and the specific implementation of each step can vary depending on your approach to the game development.
